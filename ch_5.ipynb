    "\n",
    "Training neural networks typically involves gradient-descent methods to that aim to optimize model performance by minimizing loss.  \n",
    "Early stopping is a regularization technique used during the training of machine learning model to prevent overfitting. \n",
    "- Running to full convergence can lead to **overfitting**, where the model over-learns specific details of the training data that may not generalize or apply to new data. \n",
    "- **Early stopping** provides a solution to this challenge by halting training at an optimal point.\n",

    "2. **Monitor Performance**: Training loss decreases continuously, but at some point, validation loss starts increasing, indicating overfitting.\n",
    "3. **Stopping Point**: When validation error rises consistently, training is halted to improve generalizability.\n",

    "### Advantages of Early Stopping\n",
    "\n",
    "Early stopping acts as a constraint on training, where it limits the optimization steps taken, effectively preventing the model from fitting too closely to the training data. This makes early stopping a form of regularization, reducing the risk of overfitting and enhancing the model's generalization abilities.\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Ease of Implementation**: Simple to add with minimal changes.\n",
    "- **Cost-Effective**: Unlike regularization methods (e.g., $\\lambda$ for weight decay), early stopping adds minimal overhead just requiring monitoring validation performance.\n",
    "- **Compatible with Other Regularizers**: Can be combined with other techniques (weight decay, dropout, data augmentation) to further improve generalization.\n",
    "  - Different regularization method targets overfitting from a different aspect\n"
